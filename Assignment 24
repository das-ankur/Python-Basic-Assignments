1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?
Ans. The purpose of lamda and def is same. lambda is used to declare unambiguous
function but def is used to decleare a function with particular name.
2. What is the benefit of lambda?
Ans. The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small 
anonymous functions. Lambda functions behave just like regular functions 
declared with the def keyword. They can be used whenever function objects are 
required.
3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.
Ans. map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array, 
individually. filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong.
reduce , on the other hand, takes all of the elements in an array and reduces 
them into a single value. Just like map and filter , reduce is defined on Array.
4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?
Ans. Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated 
with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time 
and have no life in pythonâ€™s runtime environment. Python does not attach any 
meaning to these annotations. They take life when interpreted by third party 
libraries, for example, mypy.
5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?
Ans. Recursive functions are the functions which can themseleves again and again 
unit the base condition is reached. It can be used for onerlapping conditions.
6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?
Ans. The function should perform a particular task. The name os the user define 
function and in-built function  shouldn't be same. Beside that, parameter and 
return value should be checked properly.
7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.
Ans. By  returning data or object, by modifying global or non-local variables 
and by generating some new process.
