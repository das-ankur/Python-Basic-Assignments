1. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to
print the string 'too low' if guess_me is less than 7, 'too high' if greater than 7, and 'just right' if equal
to 7.
Ans.
guess_me = 7
if guess_me < 7:
  print("too low")
elif guess_me > 7:
  print("too high")
else:
  print("just right")
  
2. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me and the value 1 to the variable start. Write a while
loop that compares start with guess_me. Print too low if start is less than guess me. If start equals
guess_me, print 'found it!' and exit the loop. If start is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and exit
the loop. Increment start at the end of the loop.
Ans.
guess_me = 7
start = 1
while(True):
  if start < guess_me:
    print('too low')
  elif start > guess_me:
    print('oops')
    break
   else:
    print('found it!')
   start += 1
 
3. Print the following values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop.
Ans:
for i in [3, 2, 1, 0]:
  print(i)
 
4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of the even numbers in range(10).
Ans.
even_numbers = [i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]

5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary squares. Use range(10) to return the
keys, and use the square of each key as its value.
Ans. squares = {num: num*num for num in range(1, 11)}

6. Construct the set odd from the odd numbers in the range using a set comprehension (10).
Ans: 
odd_numbers = [i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 1]

7. Use a generator comprehension to return the string 'Got' and a number for the numbers in
range(10). Iterate through this by using a for loop.
Ans:
def got(n):
  i = 1
  while i < = n:
    yield 'Got'
    i = i + 1
#Driver Program
for i in got(10):
  print(i)
 
8. Define a function called good that returns the list ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione'].
Ans.
def good():
  return ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']
9. Define a generator function called get_odds that returns the odd numbers from range(10). Use a
for loop to find and print the third value returned.
Ans. 
def get_odds():
i = 1
limit = 1
while limit <= 10:
  yield i
  i += 2
#Driver Program
for i in get_odds(10):
  print(i)
10. Define an exception called OopsException. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write
the code to catch this exception and print 'Caught an oops'.
Ans. 
class OopsException:
  pass
 #Driver program
 raise OopsException
 catch OopsException:
  print('Caught an oops')
  
11. Use zip() to make a dictionary called movies that pairs these lists: titles = ['Creature of Habit',
'Crewel Fate'] and plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop'].
Ans.
movies = dict(zip(titles, plots))
